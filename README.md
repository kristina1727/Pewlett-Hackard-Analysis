# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Orverview
The purpose of the Pewlett-Hackard Analysis was to identify those employees who would be eligible to be mentors and mentees in the new mentorship program. The first part of the analysis was to employees who may be retiring in the near future to return to work part-time as mentors. The second part of the analysis was to identify eligible employees to participate as mentees in the program. 

## Results
The analysis to identify those employees eligible to retire and become mentors showed the following items.
- Pewlett-Hackard had 90,398 employees that could be retiring in the near future
- Of those employees, 64% of those employees are in Senior roles. 33% (29,414) of those employees are Senior Engineers and 31% (28,254) are in a Senior Staff Role.

The analysis to identify those employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program as mentees showed the below items.
- Based on the parameters outlined there were only 1,549 employees eligible to participate as mentees.
- Of those employees, 54% or 718 employees are in the Senior role. 
- 
- That means there we only have, potentially, 1% of the necessary employees to learn what the 57,668 employees are learning.

## Summary
Pewlett-Hackard has a lot of seats to fill, 90,398 seats to be exact. Filling that many roles will be no small feat. That being said, we are only prepared to fill less than 2% of those seats based on the current parameters of those employees eligible to participate in the mentorship. I would highly recommend expanding the parmeters of the eligible employee population. Two additional table could prove to be useful in identifying additional employees eligible to participate in the program. The first would be to expand the birthdate range from 1 years to 5 years, looking at those born between 1965 and 1970. The second table, and one I think would be more beneficial would be to look at the number of employees who have been with the company for 5+ year or have a birthdate of 1965 or later based on their job title. This will help ensure that the knowledge can stay with the company for longer than a few years. And it will be a great way to develop and motivate the younger generations.
